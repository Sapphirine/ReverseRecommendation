I'm frankly befuddled by this restaurant's high rating.  Right off the bat, the interior is tiny and dingy.  Th serving station is right behind the cashier and looks worse than my high school cafeteria in terms of cleanliness.  I later looked it up on the NYC health department website and while grade is "pending", there are several critical violations.  

Regardless (cuz you can't judge a book by its cover, etc), the food is not good!!  I felt conned by other yelp reviews as I was very excited to come here and the whole experience was a complete let down.  I tried the lamb noodles, the beef noodles, the liangpi and the lamb sandwich (like I said, I was pretty excited to come here).  The lamb was doused in cumin and chilli powder, but the mutton-y taste was still overwhelming.  The beef noodles were extremely dry and lacked flavor.  I dumped half the chili oil that came with the liangpi into the beef noodles to pry apart the noodles.  The liangpi was the best out of the 4, but you can't go wrong with cold noodles... My final complaint is that the owner is a d*ck.  I was there when some girls were trying to sit down and he flipped out on them as someone ordered food before them was also looking for a seat.  I understand there are rules, but no need to embarrass yourself and your establishment.  I am honestly a little peeved at giving this place a 1 star, as I rarely do this, but I feel like I have to be realistic here -- this place doesn't deserve anything more.
