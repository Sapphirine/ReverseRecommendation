###General Purpose
*  Find out the insight of customer's negative reviews.
*  Provide the recommendations from the negative reviews.

###Introduction
This project focused on recommending restaurants for Yelp users based on their review article. A na√Øve approach to build a recommendation system could just be based on user queries and star ratings. However, personal interests and preferences are difficult to identify and sometimes not even aware by consumers themselves. In this project, we build our recommendation model based on low-rating reviews. The major challenge is to identify preferences of consumers, and map it to features of products.
A crucial component in this project is to recognize the relations between information hidden in negative reviews and user preferences. In the final stage, our system generates searchable words and phrases into Yelp search API to fetch recommendation results. This step mimics human actions when our mind translates preferences into searchable keywords.

Sentiment.java is used for the implementing the sentiment algorithm. In order to run them, we suggest you first build the path to make your Eclipse be able to run Hadoop and then open the run configuration to set the input path and the out put path.
